# Z80_Computer_board
A simple Z80 based computer board

The project was started when I began to try to organize my collection of integrated
circuits and found some Z80 ICs.
I also found a Vero-Wire kit that I bought many years ago but never used until now.

Address decoding is done with a Programmable Logic Device (PLD), ATF22V10C.

A test program to verify the operation of the board is also available.
