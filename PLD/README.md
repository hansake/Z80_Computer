The address decoding is done with a Programmable Logic Device (PLD).
The device is ATF22V10C and the logic design is made and simulated
with WinCUPL: https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/spld-cplds/pld-design-resources

My setup runs WinCUPL in Wine (https://www.winehq.org/) using PlayOnLinux (https://www.playonlinux.com/en/) on Linux Mint.

To program the ATF22V10C I used a home built device called afterburner described in: https://github.com/ole00/afterburner
